		<p>For this class, I plan to look at all projects, assignments, and instructions when they are released. I plan to attempt them at least 3 days in advance to the due dates. And, I promise that I will always turn in or complete my assignments on time. If I am confused on something or need further instruction, I will plan on reviewing previous lessons, consult the internet, or (in the worst cases) ask Professor Garner. I promise that all work will be my own. I will use a simple text editor like vim or notepad++ to edit all of my code and firefox to check all of my webpages.</p>
